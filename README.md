Yii2 Advanced with smarty
=============================
将smarty集成进yii2,由于国内composer实在太慢,所以这里集成完毕后放入版本库托管.
已经解决在tpl模板中使用php原生代码的问题

请注意:
你可能需要修改你的cookie密钥,它们放置在main-local.php文件中.










Yii 2 Advanced Project Template
===============================

Yii 2 Advanced Project Template is a skeleton [Yii 2](http://www.yiiframework.com/) application best for
developing complex Web applications with multiple tiers.

The template includes three tiers: front end, back end, and console, each of which

deploying the application in different environments.
